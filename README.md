# Topic 1: The Shell

When you launch your terminal, you will see a prompt that often looks a little like this:

```missing:~$ ```

This is the main textual interface to the shell. It tells you that you are on the machine missing and that your “current working directory”, or where you currently are, is `~` (short for “home”). The `$` tells you that you are not the root user (more on that later). At this prompt you can type a command, which will then be interpreted by the shell. The most basic command is to execute a program:

pwd, echo, which, cd 

`.` refers to the current directory and `..` refers to its parent directory
